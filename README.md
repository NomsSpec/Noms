NOMS, or the Networked Organized Messenger System is a newly created specification for a standard protocol for messaging applications and provides a manner for many instances to be up and running, all connected to from a single client, similar to IRC.

The NOMS Specification (the "Specification" or "Spec") will always be:
 - Free and Open-Source (Libre)
 - Available for public use
 - Backwards-compatible (Modified servers support unmodified clients)
